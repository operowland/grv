Hitherto, the sin question has always been a debacle in human history. Coupled with its many consequences, another heart-disturbing question comes from it: the essence of our existence. Via the cross episode, God dealt with sin, reversed its consequences and intervened in our course to bring us back to his purposeful intent.<br />
Thus, we are not to be docile; we have work to do. The work of Christ on the cross was only the beginning of something much greater.  The cross episode brings about the multiplicity of Christ across space and time through us with much benefit for the populace.<br />

To be guided into these truths call for some stretching. <br/>
 Until you stretch your spirit, you will not get to your full potential in life, as the flow is from the spirit to the soul and not vice versa.  <br/>

  <p align="center"> <a href="obedience_the_true_act_of_worship.php"><img src="images/3dc4.png" alt="OBEDIENCE ...the true act of worship" width="300"  align="left"  /></a> The proper response to the Lordship of Christ is to worship him. Worship is beyond attending religious services and gatherings. <br/>
In worship, we relate with the Lord from the position of righteousness as we stand in obedience to the gospel. In worship, we serve and surrender all to Christ in obedience. In worship, we continuously express our love and his life through our obedience. In worship, our lives come in union with the Lord, as we obediently trust in him.<br/>

<p > Manifestation... the man in the manifest carrying out the manifesto
Christ wants to flow through all; he allows a portion of his measure to be released through individuals. Christ had the measure in full but distributed it in parts to all believers. So Christ is reaching everywhere through us. Hence, our purposes express and extend that of Christ. <a href="manifestation.php">More</a></p>
