It is interesting and gladdening to know that Jesus secured us a place after this life on the cross. Our hope transcends this world; we know another exists and we know how to be part of it.<br />
Hitherto, the sin question has always been a debacle in human history. Coupled with its many consequences, another heart-disturbing question comes from it: the essence of our existence. Via the cross episode, God dealt with sin, reversed its consequences and intervened in our course to bring us back to his purposeful intent.<br />
Thus, we are not to be docile; we have work to do. The work of Christ on the cross was only the beginning of something much greater. It was the planting and death of the kernel to give life to multitude of kernels. The cross episode brings about the multiplicity of Christ across space and time through us with much benefit for the populace.<br />
Exploring the Holy Bible, this book emphasizes in simple terms what has changed due to Christ’s death on the cross and how you can use it to your advantage. <br />
